# Purpose

In this project, a full-stack site has been created. The site allows users interact with a database (the developer opted for using a relational database management ststem), in the form of a recruitment website.

The websites central tenet is for job seekers to view job listings and apply for a role. For recruiters, they're able to add listings to the website - in additiona to creating a listing, they're able to edit the listing, delete the listing, or view applicants for each listing.

The home page contains basic information about the sites purpose, provides a map of where the company is based, and provides a carousel of the types of roles that are held within the website.

Users are also able to get in touch with the administrators of the website via a contact page.

The target audience for recruiters who want to list vacancies they're trying to recruit for, as well as job seekers, who're looking for employment.

This website was made for the third of four milestone projects required to complete the diploma in software development program at The Code Institute.
