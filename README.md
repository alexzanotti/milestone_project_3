# Purpose

In this project, a full-stack site has been created. The site allows users interact with a database (the developer opted for using a relational database management ststem), in the form of a recruitment website.

The websites central tenet is for job seekers to view job listings and apply for a role. For recruiters, they're able to add listings to the website - in additiona to creating a listing, they're able to edit the listing, delete the listing, or view applicants for each listing.

The home page contains basic information about the sites purpose, provides a map of where the company is based, and provides a carousel of the types of roles that are held within the website.

Users are also able to get in touch with the administrators of the website via a contact page.

The target audience for recruiters who want to list vacancies they're trying to recruit for, as well as job seekers, who're looking for employment.

This website was made for the third of four milestone projects required to complete the diploma in software development program at The Code Institute.

# Value provided:

Value provided:
* Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
* The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.
* Value has been provided to satisfy the various user profiles/stories, as the website was structured around the user stories.

# Project Requirements

## Main Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python+Flask
* PostgreSQL
* Additional libraries and external APIs


## Mandatory Requirements
In order to pass this milestone project, the following requirements must be met:

1. Data handling: Build a Relational OR Non-Relational Database backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to
2. store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
3. Database structure: Put some effort into designing a database structure well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between records of different entities.
4. User functionality: Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records (CRUD functionality).
5. Use of technologies: Use HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
6. Structure: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Materialize or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
7. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
8. Version control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
9. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
10. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
11. Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository.
